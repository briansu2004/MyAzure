## My Azure Projects

### Project 6

Created Full Stack REST APIs (backend) and VUE (front-end) apps to manage Dask Kubernetes Clusters and deployed to Azure

<!-- for Hatfield-->

- Coded the functions to manage Dask Kubernetes Clusters with Go and Python.
- Monitored the Clusters with Kubectl and dashboard.
- Programmed REST APIs with Go.
- Built the UI with VUE and Vuetify.
- Containerized the backend API app and UI app with Docker, managed with Azure ACR repository, deployed to Azure AKS and then exposed the API to a public IP.

### Project 5

Created REST APIs for a new web app and deployed to Azure Cloud

<!-- for RBC / a large bank -->

- Programmed REST APIs with Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Azure SQL, GitHub, Gradle, Redis, Docker, JSON, Postman and sidecar.
- Performed unit tests with Mockito test framework.
- Used pytest test framework to build the integration tests.
- Deployed to Azure with Kyvos Kubernetes and Jenkins pipelines.
- Onboard the endpoints to the Apigee API gateway.
- Monitored with Splunk and Dynatrace.

### Project 4

Built a new web app and a new tablet app and deployed to Azure Cloud

<!-- for Ministry of Transportation and Mistry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development -->

- For the offline mode tablet device app, built the backend REST APIs with .Net, C#, LINQ, Entity Framework; created the responsive front-end UI with .NET MAUI, Telerik UI and DevTools to follow the Zeplin wireframes; and persisted data in SQLite.
- For the online web app, created the backend REST APIs with .Net, C#, LINQ, Entity Framework; built the responsive front-end UI with Blazor, Telerik UI and DevTools to follow the Zeplin designs; and persisted data in Azure SQL database.
- Performed the unit testing with NUnit and XUnit.
- Automated the integration testing with Postman and Azure Data Studio.
- Managed code repositories with Git and Azure DevOps.

### Project 3

Created a progressive web application with Azure DevOps

<!-- for CBSA / a federal government client -->

- Built a new web application with React, TypeScript, Material UI, Router, i18n, axios, formik, lodash and S3 on front-end, Node.js, winstone, dotenv, AWS Lambda functions, Amazon API Gateway, Aurora PostgreSQL on middle and back end.
- Used CI/CD pipelines for different projects with Azure DevOps and AWS CloudFormation, CloudBuild, CodeCommit, CodePipeline.
- Created UI/UX mockups and wireframes with Balsamiq Studio.
- Created an Azure DevOps organization and an Azure DevOps project; Integrated Azure Repos with the DevOps project and Azure boards; Created a CI/CD pipeline for the React application (Build, staging and production); Used Azure test and feedback tool to identify and create work items (bugs) and manual testing with Azure Test Plans; Created a dashboard for an overview of the DevOps project.

### Project 2

Built a knowledge-based ontology graph database application

<!-- for GAC / a federal client -->

- Converted relational data model to Graph data model and imported to Neo4j.
- Used Python NLP libraries and Azure Cognitive Services APIs to analyse data, extracted entities, key phrases, and categories, then do sentiment analysis with data science algorithms in Jupyter Notebook.
- Visualized the ontology knowledge graphs with Neo4j Bloom and search phrases.

### Project 1

<!-- for Canada Post / Accenture -->

On-Premises Data Platform Migration to Azure HDInsight

- **Objective**: Led the migration of an on-premises data platform to Azure HDInsight, transforming a legacy system that included **DB2**, **SAP**, and **Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)** applications into a modern cloud-based architecture.
- **Technology Stack**: Azure HDInsight, **Azure SQL**, **Azure Data Factory** (ADF), DB2, SAP.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Architected the migration process, ensuring seamless transition of data and applications from the legacy system to the cloud.
  - Utilized **Azure Data Factory** for orchestrating and automating the migration of large-scale data from on-premises databases to **Azure SQL**.
  - Optimized data pipelines to ensure efficient data flow and integration between legacy systems and the new Azure-based infrastructure.
  - Ensured data consistency, reliability, and performance through thorough testing and validation post-migration.
  - Collaborated with cross-functional teams to implement best practices and maintain the integrity of critical data throughout the migration process.
