# Azure DevOps kickstart

Azure DevOps is a set of development tools and services provided by Microsoft to help teams plan, develop, test, and deliver software more efficiently. It includes a wide range of features for source code management, build automation, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), project tracking, and more. If you're looking to kickstart your journey with Azure DevOps, here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. **Create an Azure DevOps Account**:

   - If you don't already have an Azure DevOps account, you can create one for free by visiting the Azure DevOps Services website.

2. **Choose a Project and Organization**:

   - After signing in, create an organization and project. An organization is a high-level container that can contain multiple projects. A project is where you'll manage your software development efforts.

3. **Set Up Version Control**:

   - Decide on a version control system to use. Azure DevOps supports both Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC). If you're starting fresh, Git is a popular choice. Create a Git repository for your project.

4. **Create a DevOps Pipeline**:

   - To automate your build and release processes, you'll need to set up a pipeline. Azure DevOps provides various options for creating pipelines, including YAML-based or the visual designer. You can create build pipelines and release pipelines based on your requirements.

5. **Add Your Code**:

   - If you haven't already, add your code to the Git repository. You can do this by cloning the repository locally, making changes, and then pushing them to the remote repository.

6. **Create Build Definitions**:

   - Define how your code should be built using the build pipeline. This may involve specifying build steps, such as compiling code, running tests, and generating artifacts.

7. **Create Release Definitions**:

   - In the release pipeline, specify how you want to deploy your application. This could involve multiple stages like development, staging, and production, each with their own tasks and approvals.

8. **Set Up Continuous Integration (CI)**:

   - Enable CI so that every time code is pushed to the repository, Azure DevOps will automatically trigger a build and run tests.

9. **Set Up Continuous Deployment (CD)**:

   - Implement CD to automatically deploy the application to the desired environment when a build succeeds and meets specific criteria.

10. **Configure Test Automation**:

    - If you have automated tests, configure them in your pipeline to ensure that your application meets quality standards.

11. **Work Item Tracking**:

    - Use Azure DevOps Boards to manage work items, track progress, and collaborate with your team. You can create user stories, tasks, and bugs, and track them through sprints.

12. **Security and Compliance**:

    - Implement security and compliance checks, and ensure that your pipeline and deployment meet your organization's security and compliance requirements.

13. **Monitor and Analyze**:

    - Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights to monitor and analyze the performance of your application in production.

14. **User Training and Documentation**:

    - Ensure that your team is trained in Azure DevOps and its tools. Create documentation for your processes and pipelines.

15. **Iterate and Improve**:
    - Continuously review and improve your development processes and pipelines based on feedback and lessons learned.

Azure DevOps provides a comprehensive set of tools and services to support your software development lifecycle. Start by setting up a basic pipeline, and then gradually add more features and automation to suit your project's needs. Learning Azure DevOps may take time, but it can greatly enhance your team's productivity and help deliver high-quality software faster.
